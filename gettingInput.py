#input() is a method in python that allows user to input their answer much like Scanner class in java
# name = input("What is your name dear? ")
# print("Greetings "+ name)

#Excercise: Ask for name and fav. color and then print custom message for 'name' likes 'color'
uname = input("What's your name? ")
fcolor = input("and what's your favorite color, " + uname +"?")
print(uname + " likes " + fcolor )
